IceLibrarian
============

IceLibrarian is a music library management application, designed to allow for editing tags (ID3v2, ect) information in large quantities of files, as well as the aggregation of your music files.

IceLibrarian is a pretty old project at this point, and the code isn't maintained. However, I'm hosting it here for educational purposes for those interested.

Depends on (and includes a build of) [[Taglib-Sharp|https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp]]
